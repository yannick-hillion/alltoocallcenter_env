Generates OpenAPI-compatible schema from API made with Django Rest Framework. Use `ReDoc <https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc>`_ as default interface instead of Swagger.
First-class support for API versioning changelog & method-specific schema definition.

1. Background
---------------

Django Rest Framework has an `API schema generation/declaration mechanism <http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/schemas/>`_ provided by
`coreapi <http://www.coreapi.org/>`_ standard. There are a couple of problems with the current ecosystem:

- CoreAPI is not compatible out of the box with `OpenAPI <https://www.openapis.org/>`_ which is a much more popular API standard with superior tooling support, i.e. Swagger et. al.
- The OpenAPI codec (compatibility layer) that CoreAPI team provides drops / doesn't support a number of useful OpenAPI features.
- There is no support for versioning or method-specific schema.

2. Requirements:
-------------------

This project was born to bridge the gap between DRF and OpenAPI. The high-level requirements are as followed:

- Can be dropped into any existing DRF project without any code change necessary.
- Provide clear disctinction between request schema and response schema.
- Provide a versioning mechanism for each schema. Support defining schema by version range syntax, e.g. :code:`>1.0, <=2.0`
- Support multiple response codes, not just :code:`200`
- All this information should be bound to view methods, not view classes.

It's important to stress the non-intrusiveness requirement, not least because I want to minimize what I will have to change when
DRF itself decides to support OpenAPI officially, if at all.

3. Design
-------------

- Schema are automatically generated from `serializers <http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/serializers/>`_
    * From here onwards, :code:`schema` and :code:`serializer` are used interchangably
- Versioned schema is supported by extending :code:`VersionedSerializers`.
- Metadata, i.e. versioning, response and request schema, are bound to a view method through the :code:`view_config` decorator.
- Extra schema information such as response status codes and their descriptions are bound to the serializer :code:`Meta` class
- Automatic response validation is optionally provided :code:`view_config(response_serializer=FooSerializer, validate_response=True)`

4. Constraints
----------------

Currently DRF OpenAPI only supports DRF project that has `versioning <http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/versioning/#urlpathversioning>`_ enabled.
I have only tested `URLPathVersioning <http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/versioning/#urlpathversioning>`_ but I intend to suppor the full range of
versioning scheme supported by DRF.

5. Examples
------------

Please read the `docs <https://drf-openapi.readthedocs.io>`_ for a quickstart.

Also I have recreated the example in `DRF tutorial <http://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/quickstart/>`_ with OpenAPI schema enabled
in `<examples/>`_.
